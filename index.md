#   Local Man Found Upside Down on the Sidewalk
```
"He was just.... upside down."
```

  On February 31st, a man was found laying face first on a local sidewalk near Fuckit Park. Needless to say, people were intrigued. 
	Many believed this to be a part of the [newest trend](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewsOfTheStupid/), or the [latest news](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/local-man-ruins-everything). When in reality, it was something much more distrubing.
	
```
"Well!!, Don't keep us in suspense Jackie! Was he dead???"
```

Yes and No. You see, according to Schrodinger's Cat. We may never know whether or not the man was truly dead or alive. 
Ya see, our eyes may be able to percieve the world around us, but really. **How much do we truly understand?**

# _WE DON'T._

`AND THAT's WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.`
